# JavaLearning
## This repository contains the exercises completed while learning JAVA: 
- The first exercice is always the most relevant :smile:, saying ["Hello, World!"](Main0.java)
- [Here](Main2.java) is a exercise using `Scanner` to storage inputs. And this [other exercise](Main5.java) I understood how it's used the `sc.nextLine()` command
 I didn't know how much fun could be combining JAVA and Math principles:
  - The [List of exercises part 1](Main5.java) contains exercises that:
    - Read two number and present their sum;
    - Calculate a circle area based on the input radius;
    - Calculate the difference between 2 pair of numbers;
    - Calculate the employee salary based on their work hours :money_with_wings:;
    - The exercise 5 calculates the total amount when shopping :shopping: two different products;
    - The last exercise calculates the areas of the following geometric shapes :triangular_ruler::Triangle, Circle, Trapezium, Square and a Rectangle;
   + The [part 2 of the list](Main6.java) continues to play with Math concempts:
      - Check if the number is _negative_ or _positive_;
      - Confirm if the number is _even_ or _ddd_;
      - Inform if a number is a multiple of another;
      - Calculate a game duration (depending on the game, can take many hours :hourglass_flowing_sand:);
      - Check the number interval the input number is part of, for example, if the input is 3 the number belongs to the range [0,25];
