# JavaLearning
## This repository contains the exercises completed while learning JAVA in [Udemy`s Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/): 
- The first exercise is always the most relevant: ["Hello, World!"](Main0.java) :earth_americas:	:smile:
- [Here](Main2.java) is an exercise using `Scanner` to store inputs. And this [other exercise](Main5.java) demonstrates how `sc.nextLine()` command can be used;
- I didn't know how fun it is to combine the principles of JAVA and mathematics:
  - The [List of exercises part 1](Main5.java) contains exercises that:
    - Read two numbers and present their sum;
    - Calculate a circle area based on the input radius;
    - Calculate the difference between 2 pairs of numbers;
    - Calculate the employee salary based on their work hours :money_with_wings:. In [this exercise](Main8.java), it's displayed the taxes paid based on the salary;
    - Exercise 5 calculates the total amount when shopping :shopping: two different products;
    - The last exercise calculates the areas of the following geometric shapes :triangular_ruler::Triangle, Circle, Trapezium, Square, and a Rectangle;
   + The [part 2 of the list](Main6.java) continues to play with Math concepts:
      - Check if the number is _negative_ or _positive_;
      - Confirm if the number is _even_ or _ddd_;
      - Inform if a number is a multiple of another;
      - Calculate a game duration (depending on the game, can take many hours :hourglass_flowing_sand:);
      - Check the number interval the input number is part of, for example, if the input is 3 the number belongs to the range [0,25];
      - [This exercise](Main7.java) checks the correspondent mathematical quadrant for the input number
- Currently studying repetition structure :books:
