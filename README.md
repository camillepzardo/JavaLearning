# JavaLearning
## This repository contains the exercises completed while learning JAVA in the [Udemy's Java course](https://www.udemy.com/course/java-curso-completo/): 
- The first exercise is always the most relevant: ["Hello, World!"](Exercises/Main0.java) :earth_americas:	:smile:
- [Here](Exercises/Main2.java) is an exercise using `Scanner` to store inputs. And this [other exercise](Exercises/Main5.java) demonstrates how `sc.nextLine()` command can be used;
- I didn't know how fun it is to combine the principles of JAVA and mathematics:
  - The [List of exercises part 1](Exercises/Main5.java) contains exercises that:
    - Read two numbers and present their sum;
    - Calculate a circle area based on the input radius;
    - Calculate the difference between 2 pairs of numbers;
    - Calculate the employee salary based on their work hours :money_with_wings:. In [this exercise](Exercises/Main8.java), it's displayed the taxes paid based on the salary;
    - Exercise 5 calculates the total amount when shopping :shopping: two different products;
    - The last exercise calculates the areas of the following geometric shapes :triangular_ruler::Triangle, Circle, Trapezium, Square, and Rectangle;
   + The [part 2 of the list](Exercises/Main6.java) continues to play with Math concepts:
      - Check if the number is _negative_ or _positive_;
      - Confirm if the number is _even_ or _ddd_;
      - Inform if a number is a multiple of another;
      - Calculate a game duration (depending on the game, can take many hours :hourglass_flowing_sand:);
      - Check the number interval the input number is part of, for example, if the input is 3 the number belongs to the range [0,25];
      - [This exercise](Exercises/Main7.java) checks the correspondent mathematical quadrant for the input number
- [This exercise](Exercises/Main9.java) explored the `DEBUG`, the code was already used in the geometric exercises however in `Eclipse IDE` I learned how to toggle breakpoints and the particularities of debugging a code.
- Currently studying repetition structures :books: 
  - [First exercise](Exercises/Main10.java) using `While` structure, on this code, the user should input as many numbers as they want and at the end, the sum of these numbers is displayed when pressing zero.
    - Learning further this repetition structure it's possible to understand how can be applied in real examples, [this code](Exercises/Main11.java) reads the password and check if it's valid or not
